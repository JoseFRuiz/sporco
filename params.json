  "body": "SParse Optimization Research COde (SPORCO)\r\n==========================================\r\n\r\nSPORCO is a Python package for solving optimisation problems with\r\nsparsity-inducing regularisation. These consist primarily of sparse\r\ncoding and dictionary learning problems, including convolutional\r\nsparse coding and dictionary learning, but there is also support for\r\nother problems such as Total Variation regularisation and Robust\r\nPCA. In the current version all of the optimisation algorithms are\r\nbased on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe primary requirements are Python itself (SPORCO has only been\r\ntested on version 2.7), and modules scipy, numpy, pyfftw, and\r\nmatplotlib. Module numexpr is not required, but some functions will be\r\nfaster if it is installed.\r\n\r\nInstallation of these requirements is system dependent. Under a recent\r\nversion of Ubuntu Linux, the following commands should be sufficient:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install python-numpy\r\n    sudo apt-get install python-scipy\r\n    sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib\r\n    sudo apt-get install python-pip\r\n    sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev\r\n    sudo pip install pyfftw\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n    python setup.py build\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\nThe install command will usually have to be performed with root permissions.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nScripts illustrating usage of the package can be found in the\r\n``examples`` directory. These examples can be run from the root\r\ndirectory of the package by, for example\r\n\r\n    python examples/demo_bpdn.py\r\n\r\n\r\nTo run these scripts prior to installing the package it will be\r\nnecessary to first set the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable to\r\ninclude the root directory of the package. For example, in a ``bash``\r\nshell\r\n\r\n    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`\r\n\r\nfrom the root directory of the package.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nIf the source has been obtained from a source distribution package\r\nthen HTML documentation can be built in the ``build/sphinx/html``\r\ndirectory (the top-level document is ``index.html``) by the command\r\n\r\n    python setup.py build_sphinx\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the source has been cloned from the project github, it is necessary\r\nto first issue the command\r\n\r\n    sphinx-apidoc --separate -d 2 -o source ../sporco modules.rst\r\n\r\nwithin the ``docs`` directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis package is distributed with a BSD license; see the ``LICENSE``\r\nfile for details.\r\n",
